This repo contains an API which interacts with the dataset included in the file then that API interacts with the Dashboard python file.
This all works to create a sankey diagram along with the dashboard wigets that work to allow users to explore the dataset and trends that occur in different features of the data.
Some of these wigets include:
A width and height that impact the dimentions of the sankey diagram 
A widget which allows for the adding or subtraction of the age and gender nodes for the diagram
A widget dropdown menu which allows for the user to isolate a specific entry and see which nodes it relates to. All columns can be used in this drop down.
